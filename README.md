As a SOC analyst where I spent my time investigating alerts, digging through logs and learning how real attacks look in a security environment. I still really enjoy the blue-team side of security and I’m using this GitHub as a place to build and share projects while I continue learning.

## Objective
Right now I’m focused on creating practical detection labs and experimenting with tools I’ve used in the past. I want to simulate attacker behaviour, build detections around it, and document what I learn along the way.
This is mostly a learning space for me, but also something I hope can be useful or interesting to others working in security.

## Projects
- [Detection & Response Homelab](PUT_YOUR_REPO_LINK_HERE) - A functional SOC simulation using **Wazuh**, with threat emulation, active response and integration with logs from various sources.
